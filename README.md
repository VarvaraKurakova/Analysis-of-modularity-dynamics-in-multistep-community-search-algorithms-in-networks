Problem statement

The purpose of this study is to determine the advantages and disadvantages of known multistep algorithms. During the project, existing approaches and algorithms for reducing the size of the graph will be studied while preserving its main features and characteristics. In addition, in the process of work, the results of applying techniques and algorithms to graphs will be evaluated, which will help determine which of them work better.
Tasks:
1. To study previous works, as well as the methodologies and approaches outlined in them.
2. Use different methods and approaches.
3. Compare the data collected throughout the project and form judgments about how the modularity has changed.

Theoretical background

One of the metrics of the structure of networks or graphs is modularity. This metric was created to evaluate the effectiveness of dividing networks into modules.
The modularity is equivalent to the fraction of edges. From the total number, we subtract the predicted ones that would fall into these clusters. It should be taken into account that they are placed in the house, that is, randomly and at the end it turns out in the interval.
Common and intriguing algorithms for searching for modularity: "Greedy", by Louvensky and Girvan-Newman (Greedy).
All the methods described above will be used to study the dynamics of modularity; the algorithms are hierarchical, which means that they are a set of data ordering algorithms aimed at building a hierarchy of nested clusters. Hierarchical clustering algorithms are divided into two categories:
‚óè Agglomerative methods: new clusters are formed by combining smaller clusters, resulting in the formation of a tree from the leaves to the trunk;
Divisional or dividing methods: new clusters are formed by dividing large clusters into smaller ones, resulting in the formation of a tree from trunk to leaves.
